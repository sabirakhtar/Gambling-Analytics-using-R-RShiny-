# Gambling-Analytics-using-R-RShiny-
Data was provided for multiple gambling companies. A datamart was created merging the useful data. These datasets come from the collaborative Internet gambling research project between the Division on Addictions (DOA) and bwin Interactive Entertainment, AG (bwin), an Internet betting service provider headquartered in Vienna, Austria. These datasets provide evidence from the first eight months of the first prospective longitudinal, real-time, Internet sports betting behavior study that took place from February 1, 2005 through September 30, 2005. The analytic dataset contains information representing eight months of aggregated betting behavior data for 40,499 sequential bwin Internet sports subscribers who opened an account with bwin during the period from February 1, 2005 through February 27, 2005. A Shiny app was created to show the important marketing insights observed after the data analysis.
